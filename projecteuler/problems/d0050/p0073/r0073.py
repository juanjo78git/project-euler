# Consider the fraction, n/d, where n and d are positive integers. If nd
# and HCF(n,d)=1, it is called a reduced proper fraction.
# If we list the set of reduced proper fractions for d  8 in ascending order
# of size, we get:
# 1/8, 1/7, 1/6, 1/5, 1/4, 2/7, 1/3, 3/8, 2/5, 3/7, 1/2, 4/7, 3/5, 5/8, 2/3,
# 5/7, 3/4, 4/5, 5/6, 6/7, 7/8
# It can be seen that there are 3 fractions between 1/3 and 1/2.
# How many fractions lie between 1/3 and 1/2 in the sorted set of reduced
# proper fractions for d  12,000?
# Note: The upper limit has been changed recently.
