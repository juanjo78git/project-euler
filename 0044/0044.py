#Pentagonal numbers are generated by the formula, Pn=n(3n-1)/2. The first ten 
#pentagonal numbers are:

#1, 5, 12, 22, 35, 51, 70, 92, 117, 145, ...

#It can be seen that P4 + P7 = 22 + 70 = 92 = P8. However, their difference, 
#70  22 = 48, is not pentagonal.

#Find the pair of pentagonal numbers, Pj and Pk, for which their sum and 
#difference is pentagonal and D = |Pk-Pj| is minimised; what is the value of D?
